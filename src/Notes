CI/CD:
    Continuous Integration and Continuous Development

    All of the software that we use whether it is a website or app or any operating system
   They are in a continuous state of change. We need to continuously develop and update these software
   so that the customers can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such software that will help us to
   automate this process.

 1) Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer pushes that code
 to the development server. He verifies the changes and runs few test cases to amke sure all works fine.

 2) Once all looks good, QAs will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need to take approvals
 from team leads or managers which further slows down the process.

 3) Once all looks good on QA, take approval from head of team, write an email again to deploy all the changes
 to the staging server.

 4) Once all look good on staging do the same for the production.
